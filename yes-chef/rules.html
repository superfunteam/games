    <h2 id="setup" class="font-semibold text-4xl mb-4">Basic Game Setup</h2>

    <p class="">Like a lot of card games, players gather around a central draw pile and discard pile (called <strong>The Pantry</strong>). Something like this:</p>

    <img class="md:rounded-2xl mb-8 max-w-[120%] -ml-[10%] md:max-w-[130%] md:-ml-[15%]" src="images/instructions-table-layout.png" alt="">

    <p>Each chef works to collect and complete <strong>Dish Cards</strong> to earn coins. You may play a Dish Card from your hand into the space in front of you, and immediately start assembling the required <strong>Ingredient Cards</strong> to complete the Dish.</p>

    <p class="p-6 border-yellow-300 border-2 shadow-[6px_6px_0px_0px_rgba(253,224,71,0.8)]"><strong>But watch out!</strong> Other chefs are out to spoil you, and they can play <strong>action cards</strong> onto any dish in progress.</p> 

    <h2 id="started" class="font-semibold text-4xl mb-4">Getting Started</h2>

    <p>Place the entire deck in the middle of the table (take out the rules cards first). After deciding who goes first (we like letting the youngest or the oldest go first), that chef starts the game.</p>

    <div class="md:grid grid-cols-3 gap-4 mb-8">
      <div class="bg-[#5429FF] text-white rounded-2xl p-4 pt-16 mb-4">
        <strong>Cook Dishes<br></strong>
        <span class="text-base leading-tight block mt-1">Match dish cards with ingredient cards</span>
      </div>
      <div class="bg-[#5429FF] text-white rounded-2xl p-4 pt-16 mb-4 opacity-80">

      <div class="bg-[#5429FF] text-white rounded-2xl p-4 pt-16 mb-4 opacity-60">

        <span class="text-base leading-tight block mt-1">Cook your way to the most coins</span>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>The winner is the chef that can earn the most coin by the end of the game. See: <a href="#winning" class="underline underline-offset-2">Winning</a> for complete details.</p>

    <h2 id="turn" class="font-semibold text-4xl mb-4">Taking a Turn</h2>

    <p>Each turn follows <strong>three basic phases.</strong> For quick reference, keep the <strong>rule card</strong> out on the table. On each turn:</p> 

    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-8">
      <li class="pl-2 mb-2"><strong>Draw</strong></li>
      <li class="pl-2 mb-2"><strong>Play</strong></li>
      <li class="pl-2 mb-2"><strong>Recycle</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="font-semibold text-2xl mb-4"><span class="text-[#5429FF]">Phase One:</span> Draw</h3>

    <p>At the start of your turn, draw up to 7 cards into your hand. If the pantry pile is available, you may also draw from that pile.</p>

    <p class="p-6 border-yellow-300 border-2 shadow-[6px_6px_0px_0px_rgba(253,224,71,0.8)]"><strong>Be smart!</strong> Draw your cards from the draw pile or pantry pile one-at-a-time, you never know if you'll pull a card that will suddenly make an ingredient in the pantry a must-have. Good chefs are versitile!</p>

    <p><strong>Always</strong> start your turn with 7 cards.</p>

    <p>If you don't like your 7 cards, you may discard your entire hand, <strong>into the pantry, face up,</strong> and draw 7 new cards, ending your turn immediately.</p>

    <h3 class="font-semibold text-2xl mb-4"><span class="text-[#5429FF]">Phase Two:</span> Play</h3>

    <p>During your turn, you can play any number of cards. You can play <strong>dish cards</strong> in the space in front of you, <strong>ingredient cards</strong> under the dish, and <strong>action cards</strong> to add coins to your own dishes or to sabotage the dishes of others.</p>

    <p>On the table, you may only be working on <strong>3 active dishes</strong> at one time. If you complete or drop a dish, you may start on a new dish in the empty slot.</p>

    <p>Your goal as a chef is to <strong>complete dishes worth the most coin.</strong> See: <a href="#anatomy" class="underline underline-offset-2">The Anatomy of a Dish</a> for more information.</p>

    <h3 class="font-semibold text-2xl mb-4"><span class="text-[#5429FF]">Phase 3:</span> Recyle</h3>

    <p>Place any unwanted cards back into the pantry, face-up, next to the draw pile. <strong>Any chef can draw from this pile, so stack carefully!</strong> The more cards you discard, the more cards you'll be able to draw at the start of your next turn.</p>

    <p>When you're done with your turn, tell the next chef so they can start their turn.</p>

    <h2 id="anatomy" class="font-semibold text-4xl mb-4">Anatomy of a Dish</h2>

    <p>Let's take a look at a finished dish card, complete with multiple <strong>action cards</strong>, good and bad, attached:</p>

    <img class="rounded-2xl mb-8" src="images/instructions-dish-layout.png" alt="">

    <p>Take note of a few things</p>

    <p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
      <li class="pl-2 mb-2">Collect all three ingriedients, <strong>shrimp, rice, and greens</strong>, as listed at the bottom of the dish card.</li>
      <li class="pl-2 mb-2">Another chef played a -1 coin action card.</li>
      <li class="pl-2 mb-2">You countered back and played a +1 coin action card!</li>
      <li class="pl-2 mb-2">The final dish is worth 3 coins.</li>
    </ul></p>

    <p>Once a dish is final, <strong>it is safe from future action cards.</strong> Gather the cards and turn the dish sideways, to mark it <strong>complete.</strong></p>

    <img class="rounded-2xl mb-8" src="images/instructions-completed-dish.png" alt="">

    <h2 id="winning" class="font-semibold text-4xl mb-4">Winning</h2>

    <p>The game is over when any chef completes 3 dishes. <strong>The winner is the chef that has earned the most coins on their completed dishes.</strong> Only dishes that are complete with all ingredients can be tallied.</p>

    <p>Take note of any <strong>action cards</strong> that may add or subtract coins from your dishes.</p>

    <p class="p-6 border-yellow-300 border-2 shadow-[6px_6px_0px_0px_rgba(253,224,71,0.8)]"><strong>Mogul Mode!</strong> Instead of playing to 3 dishes, this mode is a race to 10 coins, regardless of how many dishes it takes. Got what it takes to be the top earner?</p>

    <h2 id="action" class="font-semibold text-4xl mb-4">Action Cards</h2>

    <p class="mb-8">Use <strong>Action Cards</strong> to turn up the heat! Target other Chefs, give yourself more Coin, block to play defense. When an <strong>Action Card</strong> is played, discard it to the bottom of <strong>The Pantry</strong> card pile.</p>
